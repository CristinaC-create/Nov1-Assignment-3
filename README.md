My Personal Wiki Page

Welcome to my personal wiki! This repository is a central hub where I organize notes, projects, and resources related to my journey in web development. Here, I document my progress, experiments, and insights as I work on different projects.

What’s Included:

* Projects: Overview and documentation for my projects, inlcuding apps and website I'm building.
* Tech notes: Tips, trickls, and code snippets for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other tools I explore
* Rescources: A collection of useful links, articles and references that have helped me along the way.


Why This Wiki?

This wiki is both a personal reference and a space where I can share what I’m working on. By keeping everything organized here, I can easily track my growth as a developer and keep evolving my skills and knowledge base.

Feel free to explore, and don’t hesitate to check out my other repositories on GitHub!
